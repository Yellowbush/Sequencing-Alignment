# Sequencing-Alignment

Background:
Hemoglobin is responsible for transporting oxygen in blood. The study of hemoglobin protein sequences of different species can provide valuable insights into the evolution and adaptation of these organisms. Variations in the hemoglobin protein sequence can create differences in its structure that can affect an animal's ability to survive in different environments.

The goal of this project is to enhance understanding of the globin protein across different species and how it evolved through physiological and evolutionary adaptations. This can offer important implications to broaden our understanding of the function and evolution of globin proteins which can have practical applications in fields such as medicine and biotechnology.


Method:

•	Collect FASTA data from UniProt for hemoglobin protein sequences from a range of organisms spanning a variety of evolutionary distances.

   o	Current Species: Human, Chimpanzee, Bonobo, Bovine, Rat, Mouse, Fruit Fly

   o	Planned Focus/Future Work: Environmental specific species such as tropical warm-water fish vs arctic cold-water fish to understand more about selective pressures imposed by respective environments.

•	Leveraging tools from Biopython Align the sequences using a multiple sequence alignment tool such as Clustal Omega.
